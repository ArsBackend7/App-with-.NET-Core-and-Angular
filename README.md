This project demonstrates the step-by-step process of building a complete web application using ASP.NET Core and Angular, incorporating best practices and modern technologies. Starting from setting up the development environment, the application evolves incrementally, from implementing basic client-side login and registration, to adding features like routing, third-party components, photo uploads, and private messaging. Key concepts such as JWT Authentication, error handling, paging, sorting, filtering, and real-time notifications using SignalR are also integrated. The application is built using .NET 8.0, Angular 17/18, and Entity Framework Core, ensuring compatibility with the latest frameworks. Along the way, AutoMapper is used to streamline object mapping, and Visual Studio Code is leveraged to improve workflow efficiency.
